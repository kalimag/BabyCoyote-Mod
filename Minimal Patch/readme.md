# Minimal patch

This patch adjusts the vertical position of the death plane that makes the
level 6-2 "This isnt a craft" impossible to complete and contains no other
changes.

The .bps and .ips file contain the same patch. Choose either and apply it to
the `BabyCoyote/Baby Coyote_Data/data.unity3d` file with a tool of your choice.

## How to use

1. Go to https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/ (any other BPS/IPS patcher works too)
2. Select the game file `BabyCoyote/Baby Coyote_Data/data.unity3d` as the ROM
3. Select `data.unity3d.bps` as the patch
4. Apply the patch and overwrite the original `data.unity3d` file in the game folder
