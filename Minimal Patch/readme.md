# Minimal patch

The binary patch only adjusts the vertical position of the death plane that 
makes 6-2 impossible to complete and contains no other changes.

The .bps and .ips file contain the same patch. Choose either and apply it to
the `BabyCoyote/Baby Coyote_Data/data.unity3d` file with a tool of your choice.
